<b>Work Expirience </b>
<p>After highschool I started working, I worked as a commissioner for a year at a Konzum Warehouse, and after that, I was a security guard at Securitas for 2 years. From 2023 to 2025 i worked in novska at FNB Henčel where i worked on many projects that will be mentioned below. </p>

<br><br>

<b>About me</b> 
<p> I fell in love with video games when I was 5 years old and always wanted to make games. After I found out that there is Unity education in Novska I quit my security guard job and applied. Here I found out that this is the thing I want to do in my life, this is the thing that I love doing. I also found out that I love writing code, even tho I never wrote a single line of code before I came to Unity education. <br>
I like playing hard games (Dark Souls, Elden Ring) and games where I need to use my brain (We Were Here, Escape Simulator) <br>
In my free time, I also play board games, Dungeons And Dragons, go to Escape rooms and do Karting.<br>
I'm also an Archer and proffesional Archery judge.

<p> This is my final product from the unity education in Novska. Since I'm an archery judge and a programmer, I was some flaws in our 3D archery competitions and I decided to make an AR application that would be helpful. I also implemented a quit with the rules of the competition because I saw that a lot of people don't.
<br> All models were 3D scaned by me</p>
