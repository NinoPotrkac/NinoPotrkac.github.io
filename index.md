<b>Work Experience</b>
<p>
  After secondary school, I spent one year as an order picker (commissioner) at the Konzum warehouse, followed by two years as a security guard at Securitas.
  From 2023 to 2025, I worked in Novska at FNB Henčel, contributing to a range of projects listed below.
</p>

<br><br>

<b>About Me</b>
<p>
  I’ve been passionate about games since childhood and always wanted to create them. After discovering the Unity training program in Novska, I left my security job to enroll. That decision confirmed that I wanted to focus   on game programming. Starting with no coding background, I quickly built a solid foundation and a habit of writing clean code.
</p>
<p>
  I enjoy challenging games (Dark Souls, Elden Ring) and puzzle/coop experiences (We Were Here, Escape Simulator). In my free time I play board games, <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i>,
  visit escape rooms, and go karting. I’m also an archer and a certified archery judge.

<p> This is my final product from the unity education in Novska. Since I'm an archery judge and a programmer, I was some flaws in our 3D archery competitions and I decided to make an AR application that would be helpful. I also implemented a quit with the rules of the competition because I saw that a lot of people don't.
<br> All models were 3D scaned by me</p>
